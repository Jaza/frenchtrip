<h2>Bienvenue!</h2>

<p><img src="images/eiffel.gif" align="right" border="0">Welcome to the (most) official website for the Killara High 2001 trip to France. This site has been created by the students who went on the trip, independently of the school. It's where we've put our favourite memories from the trip, and where you can have a look at them.</p>

<p>OK, here's a quick run-down of what's on this site:
<ul>
<li><b><i><font color="400040">Home - </font></i></b>This is the page you're on at the moment. This page will be updated with the latest news whenever any other part of the site is changed. We will also put on any other news we feel like :-). Basically, the most important stuff is here.

<li><b><i><a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> - </i></b>Pretty much what it sounds like - photos, photos and more photos. They're sorted according to where they were taken (e.g. Eiffel Tower, Arc De Triomphe). If there's no recognisable scenery, they're in a misc. section. Also, each photo has a caption and says who contributed it to the site.

<li><b><i><a href="text.html">Text</a> - </i></b>Journal entries, quotes, stories... anything written.

<li><b><i><a href="video.html">Video</a> - </i></b>At the moment, I'm not sure if this will ever happen. However, if we can get past technical difficulties, this page will have clips from the video Mrs. Bird took on the trip!

<li><b><i><a href="fun.html">Fun</a> - </i></b>WARNING, we are going to put whatever we want on this page! Everything from red wine to yellow rice.

<li><b><i><a href="credits.html">Credits</a> - </i></b>A page recognising the contribution everyone's made to this web page, whether it be giving photos, writing articles, technical help or design help. Also there's a big thankyou here to everyone who made our trip possible.

<li><b><i><a href="help.html">Help</a> - </i></b>Having problems navigating the site? Are the pages displaying correctly or does everything look weird? If you experience a problem with the site and need help, this is the place to come.

<p>Mrs. Bird, this is a message for you from all of us. You made the trip SO special!!! It wouldn't have been the same without you. Thankyou for putting up with us for three weeks, for persevering through the bad, for making the trip worthwhile, and for being so devoted.</font></p>

<p>For those of you who are a bit confused about our trip, here's what happened. 13 of us were in France from Sept. 20 - Oct. 12. We spent the first 2 weeks in Paris, where we lived with host families in pairs, and went to the Accord Language School for 3 hours each morning Mon - Fri. While in Paris we saw all the major sights, including the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Arc De Triomphe, the Louvre and more. We also went out of Paris and saw the Palace of Versailles. We spent our last week touring the countryside. We visited the Chateau Chenonceau in the Loire, the town of La Rochelle, the beautiful Mont Saint Michel, and the Bayeux Tapestry. Before we left, we spent a day at Eurodisney.

<p>We had a great time, learnt lots of French, and fell in love with the country.

As of now there are 82 photos online, so far only from Jeremy and David. We still need photos from everyone else to fill up the gallery. Once that's done we can start on the rest of the site.</td>
